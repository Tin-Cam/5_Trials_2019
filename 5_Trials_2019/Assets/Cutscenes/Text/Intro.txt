In our town, there’s a legend that’s been passed down through generations. It speaks of an island far off the coast, barely hidden on the edge of the horizon. 
In it lies the 5 Trials. The legend tells that whoever faces the trials will have their strength greatly tested. And whoever succeeds them, will be granted a wish.
Many have travelled to the 5 Trials to have their deepest desires granted. But to this day, no one has ever returned…
The island has always intrigued me. When I was a kid I’d sneak off to the beach, just to stare at that mysterious bump on the horizon. It felt as if it was beckoning me…
I’ve made it my life’s mission to solve the mystery of the 5 Trials.
