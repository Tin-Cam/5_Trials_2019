        "George named the thing \"Specket\", because he thought it looked like a giant cricket combined with an eyeball. He thinks it sounds a lot smarter than it actually does.",
        "It’s tricky to study each trial as the beasts must be defeated to progress to the next room. Thankfully, Charlie is expedition’s strong man; he used to be one of those kids who dreamed of facing the 5 Trials.", 
        "While wearing a wireless camera, he can beat each beast while George holds the doors behind him open and Lucy and I watch the action safely on my laptop back at the camp.",
        "Strangely enough, the beasts seem to \"reappear\" after a while when they’re defeated. This has been the most interesting and puzzling question so far. How can it be possible for the beasts to reanimate? It’s as if there’s some kind of hidden mechanism in the 5 Trials."],
