    "It’s tricky to study each trial as the monsters must be defeated to progress to the next room. Thankfully, Geoff is expedition’s strong man and used to be one of those kids who dreamed of facing the 5 Trials.", "While wearing a wireless camera, he can fight and beat each beast while George holds the doors behind him open, and Lucy and I watch the action on my laptop safely back at the camp."],
